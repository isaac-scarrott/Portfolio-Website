            This is my first blog post and I don't really know what I'm doing but maybe I'll get better at these as I go on. These will describe my thought process and hopefully will help me to reflect on projects better.
          </br></br>
            Anyway onto the website. I made this website to showcase my projects (although there are not many at the moment), to create this blog and maybe some other things. The idea behind it was to create as simple as possible website that will allow people who visit it to be able to navigate it as quickly as possible and there to be no extra infomation than is needed. The only issue that I see with this website is the fact the link the my CV is a addres book looking icon. This was used as awesome fonts don't have an icon suitable for a CV however I will be looking to change this very soon. I also might get my parents (average tech savvy) and my brother (more tech savvy than my parents) to have a look at it and test the user interface to give me some feedback. I am also looking to complete the about me page tomorrow so the basic website will be completed and can post it to Linkedin etc.
          </br></br>
          Anyway, my writing skills clearly need to improve and hopefully that is something that will be seen looking back on this post in time to come.

        Well my first thoughts on my new job is that software development in the industry is completely different to software development at university! I thought it was a small smooth transition from university to work life with me knowing a decent amount about what I was doing but no, it was a real punch in the face and especially during the first few days a very daunting learning experience. The code base, the new languages, new tools, meeting new people, I won’t lie, it was a lot to take in and felt a bit overwhelmed. But I managed it and am now feel I am settling in well to the company and understanding the (huge) code base a lot more. Slowly but surely I’m getting there.
        </br></br>
        I’ll go a little bit into the tech stack of the company. We use Javascript, PHP, React, Kendo UI (ugh), JQuery, Node.js, Symfony, Doctrine and Oracle. Some of these I know decently well some I have never used (Kendo UI (ugh again)). Overall these are good languages, however Python will always have a special place in my heart. First impressions are the company culture is very good and I like the direction they are headed and definitely want to be a part of it for at least the next couple of years (maybe even doing a part time masters as well who knows...).
        </br></br>
        On another note from work I have also started the coursera Deep Learning Specialization from deeplearning.ai and the man himself Andrew Ng, to build upon the foundations I have laid down at university in my final year. Also on another tangent I GOT A FIRST AT UNIVERSITY. It is so surrell and I can’t really believe it (I can believe it because of the amount of hard work and sleepless nights I have had to ensure). This has really set the foundation now and I really can build upon this now to advance in my career.
        </br></br>
        On a final note I have also come up with (what I think is)  a great app idea that hasn’t really been done before. However it could be the app that the (especially male) youth of today never knew they needed. Not going to write too much about this on here as this is for another post, nor will I start it yet as I don’t want to put too much on my plate at once.
        </br></br>
        Anyway here is the second blog post done still don’t know why I’m doing these but I will start to do them more regularly and see how they develop.
