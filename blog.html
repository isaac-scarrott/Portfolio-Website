            This is my first blog post and I don't really know what I'm doing but maybe I'll get better at these as I go on. These will describe my thought process and hopefully will help me to reflect on projects better.
          </br></br>
            Anyway onto the website. I made this website to showcase my projects (although there are not many at the moment), to create this blog and maybe some other things. The idea behind it was to create as simple as possible website that will allow people who visit it to be able to navigate it as quickly as possible and there to be no extra infomation than is needed. The only issue that I see with this website is the fact the link the my CV is a addres book looking icon. This was used as awesome fonts don't have an icon suitable for a CV however I will be looking to change this very soon. I also might get my parents (average tech savvy) and my brother (more tech savvy than my parents) to have a look at it and test the user interface to give me some feedback. I am also looking to complete the about me page tomorrow so the basic website will be completed and can post it to Linkedin etc.
          </br></br>
          Anyway, my writing skills clearly need to improve and hopefully that is something that will be seen looking back on this post in time to come.
